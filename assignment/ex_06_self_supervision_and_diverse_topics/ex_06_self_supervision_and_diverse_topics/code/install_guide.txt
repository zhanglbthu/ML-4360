Follow the instructions for your OS to install the Python package manager conda:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/

Open a terminal in this directory.

Create a new environment named lecturecv and install required packages (numpy, etc.) via running:
conda env create -f environment.yml

Note: A typical source of error is to use an old version of conda itself. You can update it via:
conda update -n base conda -c anaconda

Before launching your notebook you need to activate the environment:
conda activate lecturecv-ex06

Depending on your configuration, you might instead need to run:
source activate lecturecv-ex06

You can now start jupyter notebook from the directory:
jupyter-notebook

If you encounter "IOPub message rate exceeded" while downloading the datasets, you can launch the notebook with the following extra flag:
jupyter-notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10

A browser window should be opened in which you can open the notebook of the exercise called self_supervision.ipynb
